Logos and other pretty things
=============================

Hypothesis has a beautiful logo, thanks to the generous work of Libby Berrie
in `issue #1519 <https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/issues/1519>`__.

General guidelines:

- Prefer vector (``.svg``) formats to raster formats (``.png``) wherever possible.
- We consider the rainbow version to be canonical.  The blue variant is provided
  for cases such as monochome versions or printing with a limited palette.

With that in mind, you are welcome to use these logos to refer to Hypothesis -
and if you're not sure whether a specific use is OK, please get in touch and ask!

For example, we often bring Hypothesis stickers to conferences but can't make
it to everything.  If you want to print your own Hypothesis stickers, upload
the image to `StickerMule <https://www.stickermule.com/custom-stickers>`__
and pick one of the vinyl options - that's how we get ours!

Colour palette in GIMP format
#############################

A `colour palette in GIMP format <hypothesis.gpl>`__ (``.gpl``) is also provided
with the intent of making it easier to produce graphics and documents which
re-use the colours in the Hypothesis Dragonfly logo by Libby Berrie.

The ``hypothesis.gpl`` file should be copied or imported to the appropriate
location on your filesystem. For example:

- ``/usr/share/inkscape/palettes/`` for Inkscape on Ubuntu 18.08
- Edit -> Colors -> Import... then select the ``hypothesis.gpl`` file in Scribus
  on Ubuntu 18.08
- Windows -> Dockable Dialogs -> Palettes -> Palettes Menu -> Add Palette ->
  Import from file... then select the ``hypothesis.gpl`` file in GIMP on Ubuntu
  18.08

Once imported, the colour palette is then available for easy manipulation of
colours within the user interface.
