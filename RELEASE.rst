RELEASE_TYPE: minor

This release adds the :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.from_regex` strategy,
which generates strings that contain a match of a regular expression.

Thanks to Maxim Kulkin for creating the
`hypothesis-regex <https://github.com/maximkulkin/hypothesis-regex>`_
package and then merging it upstream! (:issue:`662`)
