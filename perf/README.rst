====================
Performance Examples
====================

This is a small collection of examples for testing Hypothesis performance,
particularly centred on testing behaviour under coverage.

It's nothing particularly useful or principled, and we will at some point
want to make all of this more formal, but it at least gives us a useful
place to store examples we know are interesting from a performance point
of view.
