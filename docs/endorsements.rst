Who is using Hypothesis?
========================

This is a page for listing people who are using Hypothesis. If that's you,
please send me a pull request with your name, a link to your site, and a short
paragraph about who you are and your usage of Hypothesis. Ideally you wouldn't
be too subtle with the "Hypothesis is the best thing since sliced bread" subtext.

I'm particularly interested in notable companies and open source projects of
course, but I'm happy to add any non-trivial use of Hypothesis here.

Hypothesis has been brilliant for expanding the coverage of our test cases,
and also for making them much easier to read and understand,
so we're sure we're testing the things we want in the way we want.

We are definitely a serious company that uses Hypothesis for serious testing things.
Hypothesis has found so many bugs in our code! Frankly we're a bit embarrassed. Thanks,
Hypothesis.
