Who is using Hypothesis?
========================

This is a page for listing people who are using Hypothesis and how excited they
are about that. If that's you and your name is not on the list, `this file is in
Git <https://github.com/DRMacIver/hypothesis/blob/master/docs/endorsements.rst>`_
and I'd love it if you sent me a pull request to fix that.

Hypothesis has been brilliant for expanding the coverage of our test cases,
and also for making them much easier to read and understand,
so we're sure we're testing the things we want in the way we want.

When I first heard about Hypothesis, I knew I had to include it in my two
open-source Python libraries, `natsort <https://github.com/SethMMorton/natsort>`_
and `fastnumbers <https://github.com/SethMMorton/fastnumbers>`_ . Quite frankly,
I was a little appalled at the number of bugs and "holes" I found in the code. I can
now say with confidence that my libraries are more robust to "the wild." In
addition, Hypothesis gave me the confidence to expand these libraries to fully
support Unicode input, which I never would have had the stomach for without such
thorough testing capabilities. Thanks!

I know there are many more, because I keep finding out about new people I'd never
even heard of using Hypothesis. If you're looking to way to give back to a tool you
love, adding your name here only takes a moment and would really help a lot. As per
instructions at the top, just send me a pull request and I'll add you to the list.
