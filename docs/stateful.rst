Stateful testing
================

Hypothesis offers support for a stateful style of test, where instead of
trying to produce a single data value that causes a specific test to fail, it
tries to generate a program that errors. In many ways, this sort of testing is
to classical property based testing as property based testing is to normal
example based testing.

The idea doesn't originate with Hypothesis, though Hypothesis's implementation
and approach is mostly not based on an existing implementation and should be
considered some mix of novel and independent reinventions.

This style of testing is useful both for programs which involve some sort
of mutable state and for complex APIs where there's no state per se but the
actions you perform involve e.g. taking data from one function and feeding it
into another.

The idea is that you teach Hypothesis how to interact with your program: Be it
a server, a python API, whatever. All you need is to be able to answer the
question "Given what I've done so far, what could I do now?". After that,
Hypothesis takes over and tries to find sequences of actions which cause a
test failure.

Right now the stateful testing is a bit new and experimental and should be
considered as a semi-public API: It may break between minor versions but won't
break between patch releases, and there are still some rough edges in the API
that will need to be filed off.

This shouldn't discourage you from using it. Although it's not as robust as the
rest of Hypothesis, it's still pretty robust and more importantly is extremely
powerful. I found a number of really subtle bugs in Hypothesis by turning the
stateful testing onto a subset of the Hypothesis API, and you likely will find
the same.

Enough preamble, lets see how to use it.

The first thing to note is that there are two levels of API: The low level
but more flexible API and the higher level rule based API which is both
easier to use and also produces a much better display of data due to its
greater structure. We'll start with the more structured one.

-------------------------
Rule based state machines
-------------------------

Rule based state machines are the ones you're most likely to want to use.
They're significantly more user friendly and should be good enough for most
things you'd want to do.

A rule based state machine is a collection of functions (possibly with side
effects) which may depend on both values that Hypothesis can generate and
also on values that have resulted from previous function calls.

You define a rule based state machine as follows:

.. code:: python

  import unittest
  from collections import namedtuple
  
  from hypothesis import strategies as st
  from hypothesis.stateful import RuleBasedStateMachine, Bundle, rule


  Leaf = namedtuple('Leaf', ('label',))
  Split = namedtuple('Split', ('left', 'right'))


  class BalancedTrees(RuleBasedStateMachine):
      trees = Bundle('BinaryTree')

      @rule(target=trees, x=st.integers())
      def leaf(self, x):
          return Leaf(x)

      @rule(target=trees, left=trees, right=trees)
      def split(self, left, right):
          return Split(left, right)

      @rule(tree=trees)
      def check_balanced(self, tree):
          if isinstance(tree, Leaf):
              return
          else:
              assert abs(self.size(tree.left) - self.size(tree.right)) <= 1
              self.check_balanced(tree.left)
              self.check_balanced(tree.right)

      def size(self, tree):
          if isinstance(tree, Leaf):
              return 1
          else:
              return 1 + self.size(tree.left) + self.size(tree.right)

In this we declare a Bundle, which is a named collection of previously generated
values. We define two rules which put data onto this bundle - one which just
generates leaves with integer labels, the other of which takes two previously
generated values and returns a new one.

We can then integrate this into our test suite by getting a unittest TestCase
from it:

.. code:: python

  TestTrees = BalancedTrees.TestCase

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      unittest.main()

(these will also be picked up by py.test if you prefer to use that). Running
this we get:

.. code:: bash

  Step #1: v1 = leaf(x=0)
  Step #2: v2 = split(left=v1, right=v1)
  Step #3: v3 = split(left=v2, right=v1)
  Step #4: check_balanced(tree=v3)
  F
  ======================================================================
  FAIL: runTest (hypothesis.stateful.BalancedTrees.TestCase)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  (...)
  assert abs(self.size(tree.left) - self.size(tree.right)) <= 1
  AssertionError

Note how it's printed out a very short program that will demonstrate the
problem.

...the problem of course being that we've not actually written any code to
balance this tree at *all*, so of course it's not balanced.

So lets balance some trees.


.. code:: python

    from collections import namedtuple
    
    from hypothesis import strategies as st
    from hypothesis.stateful import RuleBasedStateMachine, Bundle, rule


    Leaf = namedtuple('Leaf', ('label',))
    Split = namedtuple('Split', ('left', 'right'))


    class BalancedTrees(RuleBasedStateMachine):
        trees = Bundle('BinaryTree')
        balanced_trees = Bundle('balanced BinaryTree')

        @rule(target=trees, x=st.integers())
        def leaf(self, x):
            return Leaf(x)

        @rule(target=trees, left=trees, right=trees)
        def split(self, left, right):
            return Split(left, right)

        @rule(tree=balanced_trees)
        def check_balanced(self, tree):
            if isinstance(tree, Leaf):
                return
            else:
                assert abs(self.size(tree.left) - self.size(tree.right)) <= 1, \
                    repr(tree)
                self.check_balanced(tree.left)
                self.check_balanced(tree.right)

        @rule(target=balanced_trees, tree=trees)
        def balance_tree(self, tree):
            return self.split_leaves(self.flatten(tree))

        def size(self, tree):
            if isinstance(tree, Leaf):
                return 1
            else:
                return self.size(tree.left) + self.size(tree.right)

        def flatten(self, tree):
            if isinstance(tree, Leaf):
                return (tree.label,)
            else:
                return self.flatten(tree.left) + self.flatten(tree.right)

        def split_leaves(self, leaves):
            assert leaves
            if len(leaves) == 1:
                return Leaf(leaves[0])
            else:
                mid = len(leaves) // 2
                return Split(
                    self.split_leaves(leaves[:mid]),
                    self.split_leaves(leaves[mid:]),
                )


We've now written a really noddy tree balancing implementation.  This takes
trees and puts them into a new bundle of data, and we only assert that things
in the balanced_trees bundle are actually balanced.

If you run this it will sit there silently for a while (you can turn on
:ref:`verbose output <verbose-output>` to get slightly more information about
what's happening. debug will give you all the intermediate programs being run)
and then run, telling you your test has passed! Our balancing algorithm worked.

Now lets break it to make sure the test is still valid:

Changing the split to mid = max(len(leaves) // 3, 1) this should no longer
balance, which gives us the following counter-example:

.. code:: python

  v1 = leaf(x=0)
  v2 = split(left=v1, right=v1)
  v3 = balance_tree(tree=v1)
  v4 = split(left=v2, right=v2)
  v5 = balance_tree(tree=v4)
  check_balanced(tree=v5)

Note that the example could be shrunk further by deleting v3. Due to some
technical limitations, Hypothesis was unable to find that particular shrink.
In general it's rare for examples produced to be long, but they won't always be
minimal.

You can control the detailed behaviour with a settings object on the TestCase
(this is a normal hypothesis settings object using the defaults at the time
the TestCase class was first referenced). For example if you wanted to run
fewer examples with larger programs you could change the settings to:

.. code:: python

  TestTrees.settings = settings(max_examples=100, stateful_step_count=100)

Which doubles the number of steps each program runs and halves the number of
runs relative to the example. settings.timeout will also be respected as usual.

Preconditions
-------------

While it's possible to use ``assume`` in RuleBasedStateMachine rules, if you
use it in only a few rules you can quickly run into a situation where few or
none of your rules pass their assumptions. Thus, Hypothesis provides a
``precondition`` decorator to avoid this problem. The ``precondition``
decorator is used on ``rule``-decorated functions, and must be given a function
that returns True or False based on the RuleBasedStateMachine instance.

.. code:: python

    from hypothesis.stateful import RuleBasedStateMachine, rule, precondition

    class NumberModifier(RuleBasedStateMachine):

        num = 0

        @rule()
        def add_one(self):
            self.num += 1

        @precondition(lambda self: self.num != 0)
        @rule()
        def divide_with_one(self):
            self.num = 1 / self.num


By using ``precondition`` here instead of ``assume``, Hypothesis can filter the
inapplicable rules before running them. This makes it much more likely that a
useful sequence of steps will be generated.

Note that currently preconditions can't access bundles; if you need to use
preconditions, you should store relevant data on the instance instead.

----------------------
Generic state machines
----------------------

The class GenericStateMachine is the underlying machinery of stateful testing
in Hypothesis. In execution it looks much like the RuleBasedStateMachine but
it allows the set of steps available to depend in essentially arbitrary
ways on what has happened so far. For example, if you wanted to
use Hypothesis to test a game, it could choose each step in the machine based
on the game to date and the set of actions the game program is telling it it
has available.

It essentially executes the following loop:

.. code:: python

  machine = MyStateMachine()
  try:
    for _ in range(n_steps):
      step = machine.steps().example()
      machine.execute_step(step)
  finally:
    machine.teardown()

Where steps() and execute_step() are methods you must implement, and teardown
is a method you can implement if you need to clean something up at the end.
steps  returns a strategy, which is allowed to depend arbitrarily on the
current state of the test execution. *Ideally* a good steps implementation
should be robust against minor changes in the state. Steps that change a lot
between slightly different executions will tend to produce worse quality
examples because they're hard to simplify.

The steps method *may* depend on external state, but it's not advisable and
may produce flaky tests.

If any of execute_step or teardown produces an error, Hypothesis will try to
find a minimal sequence of values steps such that the following throws an
exception:

.. code:: python

  try:
    machine = MyStateMachine()
    for step in steps:
      machine.execute_step(step)
  finally:
    machine.teardown()

and such that at every point, the step executed is one that could plausible
have come from a call to steps() in the current state.

Here's an example of using stateful testing to test a broken implementation
of a set in terms of a list (note that you could easily do something close to
this example with the rule based testing instead, and probably should. This
is mostly for illustration purposes):

.. code:: python

    import unittest

    from hypothesis.stateful import GenericStateMachine
    from hypothesis.strategies import tuples, sampled_from, just, integers


    class BrokenSet(GenericStateMachine):
        def __init__(self):
            self.data = []

        def steps(self):
            add_strategy = tuples(just("add"), integers())
            if not self.data:
                return add_strategy
            else:
                return (
                    add_strategy |
                    tuples(just("delete"), sampled_from(self.data)))

        def execute_step(self, step):
            action, value = step
            if action == 'delete':
                try:
                    self.data.remove(value)
                except ValueError:
                    pass
                assert value not in self.data
            else:
                assert action == 'add'
                self.data.append(value)
                assert value in self.data


    TestSet = BrokenSet.TestCase

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()


Note that the strategy changes each time based on the data that's currently
in the state machine.

Running this gives us the following:

.. code:: bash

  Step #1: ('add', 0)
  Step #2: ('add', 0)
  Step #3: ('delete', 0)
  F
  ======================================================================
  FAIL: runTest (hypothesis.stateful.BrokenSet.TestCase)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  (...)
      assert value not in self.data
  AssertionError

So it adds two elements, then deletes one, and throws an assertion when it
finds out that this only deleted one of the copies of the element.


-------------------------
More fine grained control
-------------------------

If you want to bypass the TestCase infrastructure you can invoke these
manually. The stateful module exposes the function run_state_machine_as_test,
which takes an arbitrary function returning a GenericStateMachine and an
optional settings parameter and does the same as the class based runTest
provided.

In particular this may be useful if you wish to pass parameters to a custom
__init__ in your subclass.
