====================
Packaging Guidelines
====================

Downstream packagers often want to package Hypothesis. Here are some guidelines.

The primary guideline is this: If you are not prepared to keep up with the Hypothesis release schedule,
don't. You will annoy me and are doing your users a disservice.

Hypothesis has a very frequent release schedule. It's rare that it goes a week without a release,
and there are often multiple releases in a given week.

If you *are* prepared to keep up with this schedule, you might find the rest of this document useful.

----------------
Release tarballs
----------------

These are available from :gh-link:`the GitHub releases page <releases>`. The
tarballs on pypi are intended for installation from a Python tool such as pip and should not
be considered complete releases. Requests to include additional files in them will not be granted. Their absence
is not a bug.


------------
Dependencies
------------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Python versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hypothesis is designed to work with a range of Python versions. Currently supported are:

* pypy-2.6.1 (earlier versions of pypy *may* work)
* CPython 2.7.x
* CPython 3.4.x
* CPython 3.5.x
* CPython 3.6.x

If you feel the need to have separate Python 3 and Python 2 packages you can, but Hypothesis works unmodified
on either.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Other Python libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hypothesis has *mandatory* dependencies on the following libraries:

* :pypi:`attrs`
* :pypi:`coverage`
* :pypi:`enum34` is required on Python 2.7

Hypothesis has *optional* dependencies on the following libraries:

* :pypi:`pytz` (almost any version should work)
* `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com>`_, all supported versions
* :pypi:`numpy`, 1.10 or later (earlier versions will probably work fine)
* :pypi:`pandas`, 1.8 or later
* :pypi:`py.test <pytest>` (2.8.0 or greater). This is a mandatory dependency for testing Hypothesis itself but optional for users.

The way this works when installing Hypothesis normally is that these features become available if the relevant
library is installed.

------------------
Testing Hypothesis
------------------

If you want to test Hypothesis as part of your packaging you will probably not want to use the mechanisms
Hypothesis itself uses for running its tests, because it has a lot of logic for installing and testing against
different versions of Python.

The tests must be run with py.test. A version more recent than 2.8.0 is strongly encouraged, but it may work
with earlier versions (however py.test specific logic is disabled before 2.8.0).

Tests are organised into a number of top level subdirectories of the tests/ directory.

* cover: This is a small, reasonably fast, collection of tests designed to give 100% coverage of all but a select
  subset of the files when run under Python 3.
* nocover: This is a much slower collection of tests that should not be run under coverage for performance reasons.
* py2: Tests that can only be run under Python 2
* py3: Tests that can only be run under Python 3
* datetime: This tests the subset of Hypothesis that depends on pytz
* django: This tests the subset of Hypothesis that depends on django


An example invocation for running the coverage subset of these tests:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -e .
  pip install pytest # you will probably want to use your own packaging here
  python -m pytest tests/cover
