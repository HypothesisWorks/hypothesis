Open Source Projects contributing Hypothesis Strategies
=======================================================

The following is a non-exhaustive list of open source projects that make
Hypothesis strategies available. If you're aware of any others please add them
the list!  The only inclusion criterion right now is that if it's a Python
library then it should be available on pypi.

* `hs-dbus-signature <https://github.com/stratis-storage/hs-dbus-signature>`_
* `lollipop-hypothesis <https://github.com/maximkulkin/lollipop-hypothesis>`_ -
  strategy to generate data based on
  `Lollipop <https://github.com/maximkulkin/lollipop>`_ schema definitions.
