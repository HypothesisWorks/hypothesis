    The general idea is that we store a table of triples (base, alternate, p).
    base. We then pick a triple uniformly at random, and choose its alternate
    value with probability p and else choose its base value. The triples are
    chosen so that the resulting mixture has the right distribution.

    We maintain the following invariants to try to produce good shrinks:

    1. The table is in lexicographic (base, alternate) order, so that choosing
       an earlier value in the list always lowers (or at least leaves
       unchanged) the value.
    2. base[i] < alternate[i], so that shrinking the draw always results in
       shrinking the chosen element.
