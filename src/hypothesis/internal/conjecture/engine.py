class TargetSelector(object):
    """Data structure for selecting targets to use for mutation.

    The goal is to do a good job of exploiting novelty in examples without
    getting too obsessed with any particular novel factor.

    Roughly speaking what we want to do is give each distinct coverage target
    equal amounts of time. However some coverage targets may be harder to fuzz
    than others, or may only appear in a very small minority of examples, so we
    don't want to let those dominate the testing.

    Targets are selected according to the following rules:

    1. We ideally want valid examples as our starting point. We ignore
       interesting examples entirely, and other than that we restrict ourselves
       to the best example status we've seen so far. If we've only seen
       OVERRUN examples we use those. If we've seen INVALID but not VALID
       examples we use those. Otherwise we use VALID examples.
    2. Among the examples we've seen with the right status, when asked to
       select a target, we select a coverage target and return that along with
       an example exhibiting that target uniformly at random.

    Coverage target selection proceeds as follows:

    1. Whenever we return an example from select, we update the usage count of
       each of its tags.
    2. Whenever we see an example, we add it to the list of examples for all of
       its tags.
    3. When selecting a tag, we select one with a minimal usage count. Among
       those of minimal usage count we select one with the fewest examples.
       Among those, we select one uniformly at random.

    This has the following desirable properties:

    1. When two coverage targets are intrinsically linked (e.g. when you have
       multiple lines in a conditional so that either all or none of them will
       be covered in a conditional) they are naturally deduplicated.
    2. Popular coverage targets will largely be ignored for considering what
       test to run - if every example exhibits a coverage target, picking an
       example because of that target is rather pointless.
    3. When we discover new coverage targets we immediately exploit them until
       we get to the point where we've spent about as much time on them as the
       existing targets.
    4. Among the interesting deduplicated coverage targets we essentially
       round-robin between them, but with a more consistent distribution than
       uniformly at random, which is important particularly for short runs.

        This is intended as a fast-track to minimize whole sub-examples that

        something like the following:

        ls = data.draw(st.lists(st.lists(st.integers())))
        assert len(ls) >= 10

        Then each of the elements of ls need to be minimized, and we can do
        that by deleting individual values from them, but we'd much rather do
        it fast rather than slow - deleting elements one at a time takes
        sum(map(len, ls)) shrinks, and ideally we'd do this in len(ls) shrinks
        as we try to replace each element with [].

        This pass does that by identifying the size of the "natural smallest"
        element here. It first tries replacing an entire interval with zero.
        This will sometimes work (e.g. when the interval is a block), but often
        what will happen is that there will be leftover zeros that spill over
        into the next example and ruin things - e.g. here if ls[0] is non-empty
        and we replace it with all zero, some of the extra zeros will be
        interpreted as terminating ls and will shrink it down to a one element
        list, causing the test to pass.

        So what we do instead is that once we've evaluated that shrink, we use
        the size of the intervals there to find other possible sizes that we
        could try replacing the interval with. In this case we'd spot that
        there is a one-byte interval starting at right place for ls[i] and try
        to replace it with that. This will successfully replace ls[i] with []

        downs!

        e.g. suppose we had the following:

        m = draw(integers(min_value=0))
        n = draw(integers(min_value=0))
        assert abs(m - n) > 1

        This can only happen if we're failing to reduce the size of the byte
        stream: The number of iterations that reduce the length of the byte
        stream is bounded by that length.

        The idea is that when we've completed the shrink process, we try
        starting it again from something reasonably near to the shrunk example
        that is likely to exhibit the same behaviour.

        We search for an example that is selected randomly among ones that are
        "structurally similar" to the original. If we don't find one we bail
        out fairly quickly as this will usually not work. If we do, we restart
        the shrink process from there. If this results in us finding a better
        final example, we do this again until it stops working.

        This is especially useful for things where the tendency to move
        complexity to the right works against us - often a generic instance of
        the problem is easy to shrink, but trying to reduce the size of a

        Then this could shrink to something like [0, 1], [0, 1].

        Attempting to shrink this further by deleting an element of x would
        result in losing the last element of y, and the test would start
        passing. But if we were to replace this with [a, b], [c, d] with c != 0

        We actually also try replacing n with n - 2, as we will have intervals

        interestingness because this takes the prefix rather than the suffix
        of the next block, so if lowering the block produces an uninteresting
        value and this change happens, we try replacing the second block with
        its suffix and shrink again.

        For example suppose we had:

            m = data.draw_bits(8)
            n = data.draw_bits(m)

        And initially we draw m = 9, n = 1. This gives us the bytes [9, 0, 1].
