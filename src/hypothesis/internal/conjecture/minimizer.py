"""
This module implements a lexicographic minimizer for blocks of bytearray.

That is, given a block of bytes of size n, and a predicate that accepts such
blocks, it tries to find a lexicographically minimal block of that size
that satisifies the predicate, starting from that initial starting point.

Assuming it is allowed to run to completion (which due to the way we use it it
actually often isn't) it makes the following guarantees, but it usually tries
to do better in practice:

1. The lexicographic predecessor (i.e. the largest block smaller than it) of
   the answer is not a solution.
2. No individual byte in the solution may be lowered while holding the others
   fixed.

# of our guarantees because we do try to shrink to -1 among other things.
