    After being provided with a parameter, either by iterating or through use

        This is a modified form of Thompson sampling with a bunch of special
        cases designed around failure modes I found in practice.

        1. Once a parameter is generated, we try it self.min_tries times before
           we try anything else.
        2. If we have fewer than self.min_parameters already generated we will
           always generate a new parameter in preference to reusing an existing
           one.
        3. We then perform Thompson sampling on len(self.parameters) + 1 arms.
           Then final arm is given a score by randomly picking an existing arm
           and drawing a score from that. If this arm is picked we generate a
           new parameter. This means that we always have a probability of at
           least 1/(2n) of generating a new parameter, but means that we are
           less enthusiastic to explore novelty in cases where most parameters
           we've drawn are terrible.
