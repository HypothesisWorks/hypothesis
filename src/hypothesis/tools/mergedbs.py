"""This is a git merge driver for merging two Hypothesis database files. It
allows you to check in your Hypothesis database into your git repo and have
merging examples work correctly.

You can either install Hypothesis and invoke this as a module, or just copy
this file somewhere convenient and run it directly (it has no dependencies on
the rest of Hypothesis).

You can then set this up by following the instructions in
http://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes to use this as the merge driver for
wherever you have put your hypothesis database (it is in
.hypothesis/examples.db by default). For example, the following should work
with a default configuration:

In .gitattributes add:

.hypothesis/examples.db merge=hypothesisdb

And in .git/config add:

[merge "hypothesisdb"]
    name = Hypothesis database files
    driver = python -m hypothesis.tools.mergedbs %O %A %B
