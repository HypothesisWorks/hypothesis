    This function appears to fail non-deterministically: We have seen it fail

    Common causes for this problem are:
        1. The function depends on external state. e.g. it uses an external
           random number generator. Try to make a version that passes all the
           relevant state in from Hypothesis.
        2. The function is suffering from too much recursion and its failure
           depends sensitively on where it's been called from.
        3. The function is timing sensitive and can fail or pass depending on
           how long it takes. Try breaking it up into smaller functions which
           dont' do that and testing those instead.
