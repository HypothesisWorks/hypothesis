    Behind the scenes streams are backed by a generator, but they "remember"
    the values as they evaluate them so you can replay them later.

    Internally Hypothesis uses the fact that you can tell how much of a stream
    has been evaluated, but you shouldn't use that. The only public APIs of
    a Stream are that you can index, slice, and iterate it.
