"""This example demonstrates testing a run length encoding scheme. That is, we
take a sequence and represent it by a shorter sequence where each 'run' of
consecutive equal elements is represented as a single element plus a count. So
e.g.

[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1] is represented as [[1, 4], [2, 1], [1, 1]]

This demonstrates the useful decode(encode(x)) == x invariant that is often
a fruitful source of testing with Hypothesis.

It also has an example of testing invariants in response to changes in the
underlying data.
