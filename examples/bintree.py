"""This is a tutorial for building a strategy from scratch rather than using
the strategy combinators.

Note that the API described herein is "semi-public". This means it will not
break between patch releases but may break between minor versions. However
it should be pretty stable and usually it shouldn't break between minor
versions either, or will only do so in a fairly easy to fix way.

We're going to build a strategy for a binary tree with labelled leaves. That
is, every element of our data type is either a Leaf with a single value as a
label, or a Split which has a left and a right element that are themselves
binary trees.

Note: This file contains both tests and implementation, mostly for ease of
following. Normally you would of course separate these into their own files.

To run these tests, install pytest (ideally in a virtualenv) and from the root
of a hypothesis checkout run

PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest examples/bintree.py
