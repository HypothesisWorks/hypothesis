"""This file demonstrates testing a binary search.

It's a useful example because the result of the binary search is so clearly
determined by the invariants it must satisfy, so we can simply test for those
invariants.

It also demonstrates the useful testing technique of testing how the answer
should change (or not) in response to movements in the underlying data.
