    Tries harder: if the thing to inspect is a class but typing.get_type_hints
    raises an error or returns no hints, then this function will try calling it
    on the __init__ method. This second step often helps with user-defined
    classes on older versions of Python. The third step we take is trying
    to fetch types from the __signature__ property.
    They override any other ones we found earlier.

    Never errors: instead of raising TypeError for uninspectable objects, or
    NameError for unresolvable forward references, just return an empty dict.
