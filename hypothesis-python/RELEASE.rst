RELEASE_TYPE: patch

Professional support for Hypothesis is available as part of the
`Tidelift Subscription`_, which gives software development teams
a single source for professional assurances about the open-source
software they use.  So if you're using Hypothesis at work,
encourage your organisation to check it out!

For non-business users - we love you too - this makes it easier to stay
top of maintainence and that benefits everyone.  We also have a shiny new
`Tidelift security contact <https://tidelift.com/security>`_, so please
report any vulnerabilities there for a coordinated fix and disclosure.
