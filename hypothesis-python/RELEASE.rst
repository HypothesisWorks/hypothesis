RELEASE_TYPE: minor

Add the |add_observability_callback|, |remove_observability_callback|, |with_observability_callback|, and |observability_enabled| methods to the :ref:`observability <observability>` interface. The previous |TESTCASE_CALLBACKS| is deprecated.

This release also adds better threading support to observability callbacks. An observability callback will now only be called for observations generated by the same thread.
