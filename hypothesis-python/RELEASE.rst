RELEASE_TYPE: minor

This release has deprecated the generation of integers, floats and fractions
when the conversion of the upper and/ or lower bound is not 100% exact, e.g.
when an integer gets passed a bound that is not a whole number. (:issue:`1625`)

Thanks to Felix Grünewald for this patch during Hacktoberfest 2018.
