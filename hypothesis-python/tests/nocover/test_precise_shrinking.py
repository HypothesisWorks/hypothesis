This file tests for our ability to make precise shrinks.

Terminology: A shrink is *precise* if there is a single example (draw call) that
it replaces, without leaving any of the data before or after that draw call changed.
Otherwise, it is sloppy.

Precise shrinks correspond to the changes we can make to drawn data in isolation
of the rest of the test case. e.g. if we draw a list, we want to always be able
to delete an element from it without affecting things outside that list. If we
draw an integer, we always want to be able to subtract from it.

An example of a sloppy shrink is that we can sloppily replace any list with a prefix
of it by changing the boolean that says if we should draw more elements with False.
However leaves all the data corresponding to the rest of the list after that prefix
in the test case, so everything after the drawn list is deleted.

Having a rich vocabulary of precise shrinks we can make allows us to more easily
reason about shrunk data, because we can look at the data and think in terms of
what changes the shrinker would have made to it, and the fact that it hasn't
means we know that it's important. e.g. this numeric value can't be smaller, this
list can't have fewer elements.

Sloppy shrinks in contrast just make the test case smaller. This is still good,
obviously, and we rely on sloppy shrinks for a lot of shrinker performance and
quality - often what we can expect is that we get to a smaller test case faster
through sloppy shrinks, and then precise shrinks guarantee properties of the final
result.
