#   test_database_listener_multiplexed -
#   Exception: timing out after waiting 60s for condition lambda: events ==
#   [("save", (b"a", b"a"))] * 2
# * FAILED hypothesis-python/tests/watchdog/test_database.py::

# It seems possible the failures are correlated on windows (ie if one db test fails,
# another is more likely to). I suspect a watchdog or windows issue: possibly a
# change handler is not being registered by watchdog correctly, or is registered
# too late, or... . A timeout of 60 not firing means it's unlikely "the machine is
# slow and takes a while to fire the event" is the problem here.
#
# It seems watchdog CI also has a similar problem:
# * https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog/pull/581#issuecomment-548257915
# * cmd+f `def rerun_filter` in the watchdog repository
