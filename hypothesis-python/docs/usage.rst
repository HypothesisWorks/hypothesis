Open source projects using Hypothesis
=====================================

The following is a non-exhaustive list of open source projects I know are
using Hypothesis. If you're aware of any others please add them to the list!
The only inclusion criterion right now is that if it's a Python library
then it should be available on PyPI.

You can find hundreds more from `the Hypothesis page at libraries.io
<https://libraries.io/pypi/hypothesis>`_, and `thousands on GitHub
<https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/network/dependents>`_.
Hypothesis has `over 100,000 downloads per week <https://pypistats.org/packages/hypothesis>`__,
and was used by `more than 4% of Python users surveyed by the PSF in 2018
<https://jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018>`__.
