## Why should my company do Hypothesis training?

If you're not using Hypothesis yet, you shouldn't start with training!

Hypothesis has [extensive documentation](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
and we have good introductory articles for people getting started with it [here on this
site](/articles/intro/). Your developers should start by reading there. Come back in a
week. We'll wait.

Now that you *are* using Hypothesis, ask your developers two questions:

1. Is Hypothesis useful?
2. Could we be getting more out of it?

The answers to both will be a resounding yes.

Hypothesis has made your testing less labour intensive and more thorough. You've found 
bugs you never even suspected were there in less time than your previous testing would 
have taken you.

But if you want to take your usage of Hypothesis to the next level and find
even more bugs with even less work, that's where our training can help.

The exact nature of the workshop depends on what you need. To find out our options, read on,
or [go back to the table of contents](#what-do-you-need).

### I need my team to get better at testing

In that case you want our **structured** workshop.

This is a one day on-site workshop for up to ten people.

It is a beginner friendly session in which we will work through a series of examples
designed to improve your team's understanding of how to think with property based tests and
to look for patterns in your code that property based testing can use to shine a light on
where all the bugs are hiding.

It's light on the mechanical details of how to use the library (that's what the
documentation is for) and heavy on getting the right sort of mindset to use Hypothesis effectively.

### I need my product to be better tested

In that case you want our **exploratory** workshop.

Like our structured workshop, this is a one day on-site workshop for up to ten people.

This is a workshop designed for more experienced developers who are already familiar with your software
It starts with a very brief introductory talk about the nature of Hypothesis and how to use it,
but the primary focus is developers writing tests for your software, with the trainer's primary
purpose being to answer questions, get people unstuck, and provide suggestions of good directions
to pursue and avenues that are likely to prove less fruitful.

Exactly what we cover will depend on exactly what your software needs, but it tends to be heavy
on giving people the technical details they need to focus their attention on the specific challenges
of testing your own software.

### I need something else, or something more

If the above don't work for you (e.g. because you want a longer course or to cover a specific topic),
we can always design a custom training course for your needs.
