## Why should my company get Hypothesis training?

Hypothesis **makes your testing less labor-intensive and more thorough**. You'll find bugs you never even suspected were there in less time than your existing testing tools and methodology require.

You don't *need* training to use Hypothesis, if you're not using Hypothesis already, why not just try it out first?

Hypothesis has [extensive documentation](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), and a body of introductory articles are available [right here](/articles/intro/) to get you started. These resources and will help you and your team begin testing with Hypothesis in no time. Give it a spin!

Now that you *are* using Hypothesis, ask your team two questions:

1. Is Hypothesis useful?
2. Could we be getting more out of it?

The answers to both will be a resounding yes.

If you want to take your usage of Hypothesis to the next level and find
even more bugs with even less work, our training can help.

The exact nature of the workshop depends on your needs. To find out more about our offerings, read on!
