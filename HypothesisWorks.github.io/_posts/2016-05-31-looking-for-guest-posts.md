I would like to see more posters on the hypothesis.works blog. I'm
particularly interested in experience reports from people who use
Hypothesis in the wild. Could that be you?

<!--more-->

Details of how to guest post on here:

1. This site is [a Jekyll site on Github](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/HypothesisWorks.github.io).
   To add a post, create a markdown file in the _posts directory with the
   appropriate structure and send a pull request.
2. You will want to add an entry for yourself to [the authors data file](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/HypothesisWorks.github.io/blob/master/_data/authors.yml)
3. You of course retain all copyright to your work. All you're granting is the right to publish it on this site.

I'd particularly like to hear from:

* People who work in QA
* People using the Django support
* People using Hypothesis for heavily numerical work
* People whose first experience of property based testing was via Hypothesis
* People who would like to write about another property based testing system (
  and ideally to compare it to Hypothesis)

But I'd also like to hear from anyone else who would like to write
something about Hypothesis, or property based testing in general: Whether
it's an experience report, a cool trick you figured out, an introductory
article to Hypothesis, etc.
