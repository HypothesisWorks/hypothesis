# This is to guard against multiple builds in parallel. The various installers will tend
# to stomp all over each other if you do this and they haven't previously successfully
# succeeded. We use a lock file to block progress so only one install runs at a time.
# This script should be pretty fast once files are cached, so the loss of concurrency
# is not a major problem.
# This should be using the lockfile command, but that's not available on the
# containerized travis and we can't install it without sudo.
# It is unclear if this is actually useful. I was seeing behaviour that suggested
# concurrent runs of the installer, but I can't seem to find any evidence of this lock
# ever not being acquired.
